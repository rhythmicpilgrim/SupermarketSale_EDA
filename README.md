# SupermarketSale_EDA
 I have utilized the widely known Supermarket Sales Dataset to conduct an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualize the findings. Additionally, I have implemented a linear regressor that takes an input and makes predictions about the rating.


# About the dataset 
The Supermarket Sales Dataset is a popular dataset used by data analysts and machine learning enthusiasts to perform various analyses, such as sales trend analysis, customer segmentation, and product performance analysis. The dataset contains information on supermarket sales transactions, such as invoice ID, branch location, city, customer type, gender, product line, unit price, quantity, tax, total amount paid, date and time of the transaction, payment method, cost of goods sold, gross margin percentage, gross income, and customer rating on a scale of 1 to 10.

To gain insights from the dataset, I have performed an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and fitted a Linear Regression model to predict the customer rating of the products sold. I have structured the code into several sections, including data loading, data preparation, EDA, model building, and final analysis.

# Findings

The EDA section explored various aspects of the dataset, including sales trends across different product lines, payment methods, customer types, genders, branches, and cities. 
* I discovered that the tax rate for the transactions is 5%, and the gross margin percentage is 4.76% on average. I also found that the sales volume of different product lines varied widely, with Fashion Accessories having the highest sales volume, followed by Food and Beverages, while Health and Beauty had the lowest sales volume.

* Another finding showed male and female customers had slight differences in their purchasing behavior, with males spending more on Electronic Accessories and Sports and Travel products, while females spending more on Fashion Accessories and Health and Beauty products. The author also found that the most common payment method used by customers is e-wallet, followed by credit card and cash. 

* Additionally, I discovered differences in sales volume across the three branches of the supermarket, with Branch A having the highest number of transactions and Branch C having the lowest. 

* I also noted that the average customer rating for the supermarket is 6.97 out of 10, which suggests that customers are generally satisfied with their shopping experience. 

* Finally, I discovered that on average, members spend more than non-members, suggesting that membership programs may be effective in increasing customer loyalty and sales.

## Conclusion
 Overall, the Supermarket Sales EDA with Linear Regression provides valuable insights into the supermarket sales transactions and can be useful for planning marketing and promotional campaigns and optimizing staffing and inventory levels during different times of the year.
